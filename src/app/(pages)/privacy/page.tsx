        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last Updated: 28/03/2024</p>
        <p>
          Welcome to Skycle.app! Your privacy is of utmost importance to us. This Privacy Policy
          outlines the types of information we access, why we access it, and what we do (and
          don&apos;t do) with that information.
        </p>
        <h2>Information We Access</h2>
        <p>Skycle.app accesses public data provided by the Bluesky API. This data includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>User avatars</li>
          <li>Public interactions between users on Bluesky</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not require users to log in or provide any personal information to use Skycle.app.
        </p>
        <h2>How We Use The Information</h2>
        <p>
          We use the public data from Bluesky to visually generate circles with user avatars based
          on their interactions. This allows us to provide you with a graphical representation of
          interactions between Bluesky users.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Skycle.app does not store any data. We fetch data in real-time from the Bluesky API for
          the sole purpose of creating visual representations during your session. Once your session
          is terminated or you close the application, we retain no data from that session.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          While we do not store any data, we ensure that the data we temporarily access is handled
          with the utmost care. Our application is designed to work directly with the Bluesky API
          without intermediary storage solutions, minimizing potential security risks.
        </p>
        <h2>Third-Party Access</h2>
        <p>
          We do not provide, sell, or lease any data to third parties. Skycle.app operates without
          third-party ads or trackers, ensuring your experience is as private as possible.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for
          other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted on this page,
          so we encourage users to check back regularly.
        </p>
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>Consent</h2>
        <p>
          By using Skycle.app, you consent to our access to the public data as described in this
          Privacy Policy.
        </p>
